## **You can help us keep this humble project alive**

Yes, although this project is free to use and for educational purposes, developing it took
time and unfortunately we do not generate income (For now).

Therefore, please consider supporting us, no matter how big or small the contribution is.
It would help us a lot to continue keeping this API with its data updated and protected from any
malicious attack.

**_Thank you!_**
