# Security Policy

## Attack Protection:

- This project has [JWT](https://jwt.io/) authentication methods to implement request tokens, in addition to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
mitigation measures to protect API routes from various attacks or data injections.
- It has some administration accounts for the creation, deletion and updating of information from this API,
and the registration of new users is blocked by security measures.

## Secure code

- It also has [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to identify and correct security problems in the source code.
- If you have any suggestions or contributions to achieve secure code free of vulnerabilities, do not forget to contact the administrator of this project.

## Report vulnerabilities
â€‹
Although the main IdolAPI repository has vulnerability detection tools, such as: Dependabot to automate dependency management,
this does not guarantee 100% security. Therefore, if you have any problems, detected any flaws or vulnerabilities, you can contact the administrator.
We will do everything possible to solve both the problems presented and also the concerns of users.
