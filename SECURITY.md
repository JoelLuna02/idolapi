## Attack Protection:

- This project has JWT authentication methods to implement request tokens or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
mitigation measures to protect API routes from various attacks or data injections.
- It has some administration accounts for the creation, deletion and updating of information from this API,
and the registration of new users is blocked by security measures.

## Secure code

- It also has Eslint and Prettier to identify and correct security problems in the source code.
- If you have any suggestions or contributions to achieve secure code free of vulnerabilities, do not forget to contact the administrator of this project.

## Report vulnerabilities
â€‹
Although the main IdolAPI repository has vulnerability detection tools, such as: Dependabot to automate dependency management,
this does not guarantee 100% security. Therefore, if you have any problems, detected any flaws or vulnerabilities, you can contact the administrator.
We will do everything possible to solve both the problems presented and the concerns of users.
